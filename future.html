    <h1>Purpose of Galvanize</h1>
      <br>
        <p>I am excited to start my career path in an industry that has become a necessity in how our society functions. I am a creative, critical and holistic person. I belive Glavanize will give me the tools in becoming a proficient junior programmer. I have been programming for a while and I defintely enjoy the aspect of creating something of your own and then sharing it with your peers. I plan to stay in this industry for a while, as I find it important to bridge the gap between the tech industry and women coders</p>
        <br>
          <p>I hope to help others be introduced into the tech world and make it more inviting for others to experience. My plan for the future is to gain my skills as a programmer and eventually teach new programmers how fun programming can be. </p>
