  <h1>About Me</h1>
    <br>
  <p> I am a recent college graduate excited to start a new career in full stack engineering/Web Development. I consider myself to be a Global Nomad, more specifically a "Diplobrat". My parents snagged my brother and I from Jakarta, Indonesia and we have been traveling the world ever since. The majority of my life has been on American compounds in Southeast Asia.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p> My best friend in the whole world is my father, Gregory Gilbert Fergin. He's the most adorable, kind, genuine, sweet, quiet, intelligent man I have ever met. We enjoy travelling and exploring new countries together. One of the best memories I have with him is when I was interning in Singapore and he would take me out to lunch everyday because he missed me. Nobody deserves my father but somehow he sticks around my family.</p>
